# Usage: myJoin [-H] -f key1,key2,key3 *.txt

# def main():
	# Process flags:
	#	fields, unique, duplicate, etc.
	#	fail conditions (conflicting flags, args)

	# For each passed file ('*.txt')
	#	Process header (or not--if `-f` nor `-H` are not used)
	#	For each line of file:
	#		key = Load_key(row) (could be whole line)
	#		attributes{key} = Load_attributes(row) (could be none, if -f is not used)
	
	# For each key:
	#	Print key, ordered attribues
	#		This print should be aware of -d and -n flags.

# def Load_attributes():
#	make sure new attributes (from header) have not been seen previously
#	if they have been seen, rename
#	assign values from split row to attributes
